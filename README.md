# student-record
A simple 'learning analytics' tool for recording, analysing and presenting data and providing insights relating to student attendance and engagement. This is a collaborative project with my colleagues James Tooze, Pablo Prieto, Gareth Owen-Lloy and Cate Grundy who all teach on the BSc Product Design and BEng/MEng Design Engineering courses at the University of Brighton. This repository was developed by Derek Covill from the Univeristy of Brighton (d.covill@brighton.ac.uk, https://research.brighton.ac.uk/en/persons/derek-covill).

This project will be presented at the International Engineering and Product Design Education Conference (EPDE) in Birmingham in September 2024.

Further details, example files, templates and documentation is coming soon!
